## About

### License

This repo and all the printables are [MIT Licensed](/LICENSE.md), meaning you can use or modify them for free as long as
you provide attribution (a link to [github.com/blaketyro/printables](https://github.com/blaketyro/printables)
suffices).

Please, save and print them and use them in your classrooms and workplaces and for personal edification. I make
them for fun as a hobby and that's exactly what I want to see happen!

### Project Structure

All the files for each printable exist in their own folder in the main [Project](/Project) directory. The printables are
made in the [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/designer/) vector graphics software and the original
[afdesign](https://fileinfo.com/extension/afdesign) files can found in each printable's folder.

The files are exported at three paper sizes

-   Letter (8.5in×11in)
-   A4 (210mm×297mm)
-   Poster (24in×36in)

and in three file formats:

-   PDF (recommended for printing)
-   PNG (at 200 dpi)
-   SVG

giving 9 final files for each printable.

A pre-commit hook runs [pre-commit.py](/Project/pre-commit.py) to create this readme with the table above, and improve
the names Affinity Designer gives the files.

### Inspiration

Computer science is my favorite field of study. There are endless topics to learn about and you get to be very exacting.
The problem is there are _too_ many things to learn about and remember, so I started making little cheat-sheet word
documents to help me memorize important computer science topics. Then I realized I could make better diagrams using my
skills as a former vector graphics artist, and thought I may as well make them public while I'm at it.

I wanted them to be printable (and not just webpages) since anything printable can work fine as a webpage, but not
always vice versa.

They are intentionally mostly black and white since not everyone has a color printer or can even see colors.
It also just makes the design easier and faster.
